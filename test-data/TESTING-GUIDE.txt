COMPLETE TESTING GUIDE FOR SELF-IMPROVING SYSTEM
=================================================

STEP 1: ADD EXAMPLES VIA ADMIN PAGE (/admin)
--------------------------------------------
Use files from: test-data/

| Resume File                          | Job File                    | Outcome           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| resume-1-marketing-positive.txt      | job-1-marketing-manager.txt | Positive > Interview |
| resume-2-data-scientist-positive.txt | job-2-data-scientist.txt    | Positive > Offer     |
| resume-3-junior-dev-negative.txt     | job-3-senior-developer.txt  | Negative > Rejected ATS |
| resume-4-product-manager-positive.txt| job-4-product-manager.txt   | Positive > Interview |
| resume-5-nurse-positive.txt          | job-5-icu-nurse.txt         | Positive > Offer     |

For each pair:
1. Go to /admin
2. Paste job description from job-*.txt
3. Paste resume text from resume-*.txt (or upload .pdf/.docx from documents/)
4. Select outcome
5. Click "Submit & Auto-Label"
6. Review and save


STEP 2: TEST USER FLOW (/dashboard)
-----------------------------------
Use files from: test-data/user-test-jobs/

These are SIMILAR (but not identical) job descriptions that should
trigger the self-improving system to find matches.

| Upload This Resume                   | With This Job Description              | Expected Result |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| documents/resume-1-marketing-*.pdf   | user-test-jobs/test-job-for-marketing.txt | Should find match, show success rate |
| documents/resume-2-data-scientist-*.pdf | user-test-jobs/test-job-for-data-scientist.txt | Should find match, show success rate |
| documents/resume-4-product-manager-*.pdf | user-test-jobs/test-job-for-product-manager.txt | Should find match, show success rate |
| documents/resume-5-nurse-*.pdf       | user-test-jobs/test-job-for-nurse.txt    | Should find match, show success rate |
| documents/resume-3-junior-dev-*.pdf  | user-test-jobs/test-job-for-junior-dev.txt | Should show LOW success (negative example) |


WHAT TO VERIFY:
---------------
1. After admin upload:
   - Example appears in "All Examples" table
   - Stats update (total count, industry breakdown)

2. After user flow test:
   - Format Recommendations section shows "Based on X applications"
   - Success rates reflect the outcomes you added
   - Similar jobs are being matched (check console/network for API calls)


FOLDER STRUCTURE:
-----------------
test-data/
├── documents/                    # PDF and DOCX resumes for upload
│   ├── resume-1-marketing-positive.pdf
│   ├── resume-1-marketing-positive.docx
│   └── ... (all 5 resumes in both formats)
├── user-test-jobs/               # Job descriptions for user flow testing
│   ├── test-job-for-marketing.txt

QUICK TEST SEQUENCE:
--------------------
1. Admin: Add resume-2-data-scientist + job-2-data-scientist (Positive > Offer)
2. Dashboard: Upload resume-2-data-scientist.pdf + test-job-for-data-scientist.txt
3. Check: Format recommendations should say "Based on 1 application" with success rate
